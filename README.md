# Red Team vs. Blue Team (Pen-Testing) Project

Built using Microsoft Azure, this project consists of 4 VMs, including an vulnerable machine, a Kali Linux machine, an ELK Stack machine, and a HyperV machine, to carry out a reverse shell exploit, followed by a comprehensive report including a hardening solution for the vulnerable machine.

This project focused on using the following skills to first exploit a system and then write a report for the exploited system:

- Penetration testing with Kali Linux.

- Log and incident analysis with Kibana.

- System hardening and configuration.

- Reporting, documentation, and communication.
